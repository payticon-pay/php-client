/**
* The Create Order endpoint in a payment system is like the architect laying the foundation for a seamless transaction. 
* This crucial API allows users to initiate a new order, specifying details such as the items being purchased, 
* the amount, and any additional information needed for processing.
* Once the order is successfully created, the magic happensâ€”it generates a paywallUrl. 
* 
* This special link serves as a gateway, guiding users to the payment interface where they can fulfill their purchase. 
* It's like a digital usher, ensuring customers reach the right destination effortlessly.
* 
* In essence, the Create Order endpoint not only kickstarts the payment process
* but also hands users the golden ticket in the form of a paywallUrl,
* paving the way for a smooth and secure payment journey.
